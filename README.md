# addToCart
React-Redux-Bootstrap-MaterialUi

This is an example of a short GitHub repository description for a project that implements a full shopping cart functionality using React, Redux, Material UI, Bootstrap, and local storage:

This is a React-based e-commerce project that allows users to add items to their shopping cart and store the cart data in local storage. The project uses Redux for state management, Material UI and Bootstrap for styling and layout, and local storage for persistent data storage.

Features:

-Add items to the cart and see the cart total update in real-time.
-View a summary of items in the cart and the total price.
-Increment or decrement the quantity of items in the cart.
-Remove items from the cart.
-Store cart data in local storage so it persists across sessions.
This project demonstrates how to integrate React with Redux for state management and use Material UI and Bootstrap for styling and layout. The use of local storage for data persistence makes it easy for users to resume shopping later without losing their cart data.
